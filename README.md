# About

Somewhere around 10 years ago I built a media reviewer, tagging and organization service.  This service hasn't really been maintained, and the storage method made it impossible to organize by date, which in hindsight was really silly.

The database is a simple raw YAML format.  This simple golang library is to convert that content into a flat folder structure, making it much easier to navigate and review. 

While open source, this serves no purpose outside of my legacy media manager.
